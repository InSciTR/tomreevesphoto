      <b>Tom Bodhi Reeves</b> is a New York City-based interdisciplinary photographer whose work explores beauty in motion and the stillness of the present moment. From high-gloss fashion portraits to street-level vignettes, his lens finds meaning in both the grand and the intimate.

      In 2022, Reeves achieved global recognition when his spontaneous macro image of a snowflake nestled in goldendoodle fur won Apple’s Shot on iPhone Macro Challenge. The photograph appeared on a billboard in Manhattan, was featured by The Washington Post, People, USA Today, Elle, and others, and was personally shared by Tim Cook as one of the competition’s most moving entries.

      Since then, Reeves’ visibility has continued to grow. He’s become a fixture in the New York Fashion Week street style scene, capturing all the details and collaborating with top talent from around the world. In 2024, he founded Lightwalkers, a photography collective rooted in community, creative freedom, and reverence for light—both literal and metaphorical. Whether leading photowalks or documenting fleeting street moments, Reeves invites others to slow down and see more clearly.

      His signature is a scale-shifting visual language that spans epic cityscapes, micro-textures, and soulful human portraiture. This unique exploration of scale serves not just as an artistic expression but also as an invitation—a call to marvel and revel in the beauty life presents, from the monumental to the minute. It’s a practice in attention and presence, grounded in motion, contrast, and the inherent optimism in humanity and the world we create.

      Raised in Northern California and creatively shaped by the wilds of Oregon and teenage pilgrimages to Burning Man, Reeves first picked up a camera with serious intention when traveling through Southeast Asia in 2005. He later settled in Eugene, Oregon, where he got involved in the local music scene, managed a portrait studio, curated gallery exhibitions, and was voted Best Visual Artist by Eugene Weekly readers in 2007. His early work was published on multiple covers of The Sun Magazine and featured in photography anthologies like Capture Lane County and Burning Book: A Visual History of Burning Man.

      In 2012, after completing a degree in medical technology, he moved to New York City and began working in ophthalmic imaging and technology, capturing high-definition macro photos of the human eye. This blend of art and science deepened his fascination with perception and visual clarity, themes that still echo through his fine art.

      Tom’s street work, including his evolving video series <b>Street Cinema</b>, is a love letter to the city’s rhythms and contradictions. Shot with a quiet ‘ninja-like’ discretion, his candid photographs and handheld videos capture New York’s pulse through fleeting portraits of strangers in motion. His choice of frames reflect a reverence for unguarded moments—the calm of someone waiting at a crosswalk, the softness behind a glance. These glimpses are both documentary and poetic, shaped by a desire to confront modern isolation by honoring the presence of others. His lens reveals the shared tenderness and individuality in each passerby, a reminder that even in solitude, we are never truly alone.

    <p class="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">
      In recent years, Reeves has expanded his toolkit to include generative AI, creating painterly variations and surreal extensions of his own photographs. For him, this intersection of lens and latent model opens new pathways into visual storytelling. Rather than capturing light in a single moment, these works use machine learning and imagination to extend what a camera sees into what light might suggest. In his view, it doesn’t replace photography’s foundation of drawing with light—it reframes it, allowing him to build on memory, context, and creative intent in new and unexpected ways.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">
      Ever-curious and never static, Reeves holds advanced degrees in Informatics and Information Science, which inform his thoughtful, systems-oriented approach to both technology and art. Looking ahead, he’s drawn to new modes of collaboration and is particularly excited about projects that fuse art and technology across digital and physical mediums.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md text-gray-400 mb-4">
      His creative journey continues, rooted in the present moment—the streets, the light, the subtle aliveness of everything unfolding everywhere all at once.
