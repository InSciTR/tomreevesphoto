In early 2022, my iPhone photo of a tiny snowflake nestled in my dog's coat advanced from the small screen to a massive billboard in Manhattan, thanks to the **#ShotOniPhone Macro Challenge**. Shot on an unmodified iPhone 13 Pro and chosen as one of ten winners worldwide, the photo was recognized for capturing the minute marvels of life in intricate detail.

This honor reminds me that great photography is about learning to see and appreciate beauty at every scale.

The theme for that year's challenge was macro photography—an encouraging bid to slow down and appreciate life's tiny treasures as the world reeled from a global pandemic. The macro capability of the iPhone empowered me to encapsulate this idea effortlessly and intuitively, leading to a winning shot with my iPhone in one hand and my puppy's leash in the other.

The victory was not only shared with my fellow winners and the amazing people at Apple, but also with my partner Saranya and our dog Mimi, both of whom encouraged me to go out on a walk in the snow that morning.

The win was amplified by numerous media outlets and was featured in *People*, *Wired*, *Complex*, *Tom's Guide*, *Elle*, *CNET*, *USA Today*, *i-D*, *MacRumors*, *PetaPixel*, *9to5Mac*, *Times of India*, *Gizmodo*, *Popular Photography*, *Cult of Mac*, and *Macworld*. I was interviewed by *Input Magazine*, *The Washington Post*, *TechRadar*, *GadgetMatch*, *The Shutter Angle*, and the University at Albany, SUNY.

The winning photograph, focused on the delicate latticework of one perfect snowflake caught on a thread of goldendoodle hair on a cold February morning in Manhattan's Riverside Park, was hailed for its aesthetic and narrative strength. The image was noted for conveying a mood, capturing the snowflakes' transient beauty and telling a larger story of movement and life. One of the judges, Kaiann Drance, VP of iPhone marketing at Apple, playfully inquired if the snowflakes were real or tiny jewels and applauded the detail captured through the iPhone’s built-in macro lens.

To have my photograph celebrated across Apple’s various platforms—including Apple Newsroom, apple.com, Apple Instagram, Apple Stores, and *Shot on iPhone* billboards—is indeed a grand honor. Remarkably, my single photo submission was selected as a finalist from among thousands of submissions to TBWA\Media Arts Lab, the same agency behind my all-time favorite ad campaign, “Think Different”.

To have my work recognized at that same agency and then by an international panel of expert judges—Anand Varma, Apeksha Maker, Peter McKinnon, Paddy Chao, Yik Keat Lee, Arem Duplessis, Billy Sorrentino, Della Huff, Kaiann Drance, and Pamela Chen—feels absolutely incredible.

Gratitude extends to everyone at Apple and the judges for this opportunity. I also congratulate my fellow finalists, hoping that our collective success has inspired iPhone photographers worldwide to seek fresh perspectives and make more art!
